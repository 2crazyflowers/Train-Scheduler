Train Scheduler
Project Overview
This project was an assignment in the U of M FullStack Bootcamp. I created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js. The website provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station. 

Getting Started
??These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. ??So they should fork it to their own github page??
The site is deployed at https://2crazyflowers.github.io/Train-Scheduler/. You can use this to see the trains that are already set up in Firebase. You have to refresh the page to update the minutes to arrival and the next arrival time. You can enter new train information below the Current Train Schedule, in the Add New Train Information card. Once you enter the information and submit, it will add the new train to the Current Train Schedule. 

Prerequisites
There are no prerequisite softwares that you need to install to run this application. This application is deployed in GitHub.

Built With
Bootstrap - To do basic css
Firebase - to store train name, train frequency and train start time
Moment.js - This pulls the data from Firebase and manipulates the data to give next train arrival time and minutes away

# Train-Scheduler Assigment 

Firebase Assignment - Train Scheduler (Basic - Recommended)

Overview
In this assignment, you'll create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. Your app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

Setup
We'll leave that up to you -- however you like. Just make sure you're using Firebase to store data, GitHub to backup your project, and GithHub Pages to host your finished site.
Instructions
Make sure that your app suits this basic spec:

When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
Train Name
Destination
First Train Time -- in military time
Frequency -- in minutes
Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.
Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.
Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get Creative!
Example Site
train homework

Bonus (Extra Challenges)
Consider updating your "minutes to arrival" and "next train time" text once every minute. This is significantly more challenging; only attempt this if you've completed the actual activity and committed it somewhere on GitHub for safekeeping (and maybe create a second GitHub repo).

Try adding update and remove buttons for each train. Let the user edit the row's elements-- allow them to change a train's Name, Destination and Arrival Time (and then, by relation, minutes to arrival).

As a final challenge, make it so that only users who log into the site with their Google or GitHub accounts can use your site. You'll need to read up on Firebase authentication for this bonus exercise.

Minimum Requirements
Attempt to complete homework assignment as described in instructions. If unable to complete certain portions, please pseudocode these portions to describe what remains to be completed.

Create a README.md
Add a README.md to your repository describing the project. Here are some resources for creating your README.md. Here are some resources to help you along the way:

Add To Your Portfolio
After completing the homework please add the piece to your portfolio. Make sure to add a link to your updated portfolio in the comments section of your homework so the TAs can easily ensure you completed this step when they are grading the assignment. To receive an 'A' on any assignment, you must link to it from your portfolio.

One More Thing
If you have any questions about this project or the material we have covered, please post them in the community channels in slack so that your fellow developers can help you! If you're still having trouble, you can come to office hours for assistance from your instructor and TAs.

Good Luck!
